# this command adds your key to your projects auth.json file
# replace yourLicenseAuthentificationKey with your own key
composer config --auth http-basic.hyva-themes.repo.packagist.com token yourLicenseAuthentificationKey

composer config repositories.private-packagist composer https://hyva-themes.repo.packagist.com/yourProjectName/
```

Run those commands, and then, install the theme and its dependencies with composer:

```sh
composer require hyva-themes/magento2-default-theme
```
Next, run the Magento setup command:

```sh
bin/magento setup:upgrade
```
Navigate to the `Content > Design > Configuration` admin section and activate the hyva/default theme.
